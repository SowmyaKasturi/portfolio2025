# üîó TinyURL - Flask-Based URL Shortener

This is a complete backend implementation of a URL shortener service, built with **Flask**, featuring persistent storage, caching, and multiple authentication methods. Inspired by real-world services like TinyURL, this app is structured to reflect production-grade backend design and development.

---

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### üß± Core Functionality
- URL shortening using hash-based slugs
- Redirect logic to the original URL
- Auto-handling of duplicates and edge cases

### üóÉÔ∏è Storage
- In-memory logic ‚Üí upgraded to SQLite using SQLAlchemy
- Full model: `id`, `original_url`, `hashcode`, `created_at`

### ‚ö° Caching
- `lru_cache` (local memory cache) for fast repeated lookups
- Redis integration for scalable, multi-process caching

### üîê Authentication
Multiple authentication layers implemented:
- ‚úÖ **API Key Auth** via `X-API-Key` header
- ‚úÖ **Basic Auth** using HTTP Authorization headers
- ‚úÖ **JWT Auth** for stateless, token-based API protection

> Frontend or API clients are expected to request a token from `/login` and include it in headers using:
> ```
> Authorization: Bearer <token>
> ```
